\textbf{Drought Category} & \textbf{Percent of Occurrence} & \textbf{Characteristics and Potential Effects} \\ \hline
\textbf{D0 - Anomalía seca} (Abnormally dry) & 20\% to $<$30\% & Pre-drought conditions or lingering effects post-drought. Can affect agriculture, soil moisture, and air quality. \\ \hline
\textbf{D1 - Sequía moderada} (Moderate drought) & 10\% to $<$20\% & Possible crop/pasture damage, low water supplies, and voluntary water-use restrictions. \\ \hline
\textbf{D2 - Sequía severa} (Severe drought) & 5\% to $<$10\% & Likely crop/pasture losses, water shortages, and some mandatory water-use restrictions. \\ \hline
\textbf{D3 - Sequía extrema} (Extreme drought) & 2\% to $<$5\% & Major crop/pasture losses, widespread water shortages, and mandatory water-use restrictions. \\ \hline
\textbf{D4 - Sequía excepcional} (Exceptional drought) & $<$2\% & Widespread crop and pasture failures, water emergencies, and severe water-use restrictions. \\ \hline
